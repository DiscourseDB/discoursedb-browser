TODO: add setup instructions here, including key/certificate

To run locally as a test without bothering to register certificates:
   Run the server in Eclipse
   must first go to https://localhost:5980, try to access it and fail, and approve the risky access.
   Make sure you've added your own google ID to the database as a user
   Run http-server -o -S -C <your cert.pem file>
   must have key.pem file in this directory
